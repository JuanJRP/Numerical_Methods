# Numerical_Methods with Graphs

This repository contains implementations of various numerical methods used to solve mathematical problems, along with graphical representations that illustrate the results. The purpose of this project is to provide educational and practical examples to learn and apply different numerical approximation techniques.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (matplotlib, numpy, scipy)

You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt    
```

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JuanJRP/Numerical_Methods.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Numerical_Methods
3. Run the script corresponding to the numerical method you want to use. For example, to run the bisection method:
    ```bash
    python Biseccion.py
